bkDownload control 
2003 Dan Redding - Blue Knot Software
No winsock or other control library required
w/ Demo Test form

Possible uses:

- Retrieve customized batch files

Original idea for using the AsyncRead functions to D/L files by 'Chloe'

Though the same methods for downloading are used, this version was written 
from scratch and differs from the above as follows:
+ Downloads can be canceled 
+ It is a visible control that can act as a progress bar
+ Events and properties for additional information
+ Option to wait for DL to complete
+ Smart file naming given just a path (not neccessary to change for each file),
  and the File or Redirect URL
+ Options to Fail or Rename if redirected
- One DL at a time (though as you see in the demo project, multiple asynchronous 
  downloads are still possible w/ an array of the control)
